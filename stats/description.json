It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. <\/p>\n<p>Members of the R Consortium and their representatives are bound to follow this R Community Code of Conduct (which is based on the Python Community Code of Conduct). We encourage all members of the R community to likewise follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep <b>R<\/b> a positive, successful, and growing community. <\/p> \n<b>R Community Code of Conduct <\/b>\n<p>A member of the R Community is: <\/p>\n<p><b>Open:<\/b> Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on projects, working groups, packages, problems, or otherwise. We're receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We're accepting of anyone who wishes to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where all can participate and everyone can make a difference. <\/p>\n<p><b>Considerate:<\/b> Members of the community are considerate of their peers — other R users. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that oftentimes the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views. <\/p>\n<p><b>Respectful:<\/b> Members of the community are respectful. We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the R community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues. <\/p>\n<p>Overall, we're good to each other. We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to. If we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally. <\/p>\n<p><b>Questions/comments/reports?<\/b> Please write to the Code of Conduct address: <i>conduct@r-consortium.org<\/i>.
