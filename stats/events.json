He will be discussing:<\/p> <p>## Geocomputation with R, data science, open source software and geo data<\/p> <p>This talk will introduce *Geocomputation with R*, a new book on using R to work with geographic data. It covers some of the key contents from the book and provides some examples of what is possible when geographic datasets are approached from a *data science* perspective, that ensures reproducibility. I'll show how working with geographic data has become much easier and more user friendly over the years, and demonstrate the importance of geographic data for informing policy.<\/p> ","visibility":"public","duration":3600000,"rsvp_limit":45},{"created":1549532824000,"id":"258756859","name":"\"Using R to help plan the future of transport\" & \"easystats: Make R stats easy!\"","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"upcoming","time":1550079000000,"local_date":"2019-02-13","local_time":"18:30","updated":1549716887000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":28,"venue":{"id":26036824,"name":"JobMatchMe GmbH","lat":53.5474,"lon":9.9653,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Zirkusweg 2","city":"Hamburg ","country":"de","localized_country_name":"Germany","address_2":"20359"},"group":{"created":1411194184000,"name":"Hamburg R User Group","id":17102372,"join_mode":"open","lat":53.55,"lon":10,"urlname":"Hamburg-R-User-Group","who":"R users","localized_location":"Hamburg, Germany","state":"","country":"de","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Berlin"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/Hamburg-R-User-Group/events/258756859/","description":"<p>Hi everyone!<\/p> <p>We are happy to announce our second Meetup in 2019 which will be held on Wednesday 13th of February, from 6.30pm (doors open at 6.15pm). The venue is JobMatchMe, Zirkusweg 2, 10th floor of the Astra Tower. As usual, the meeting will be open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome!<\/p> <p>The agenda for this meetup is<br/>1. Welcome / AOB<br/>2. Mark’s talk + Q &amp; A<br/>3. Daniel's ⚡ talk + Q &amp; A<br/>4. 🍺 &amp; 🍔 at TBA<\/p> <p>In our first talk, Mark Padgham will provide an overview of several inter-related R packages for analysing urban dynamics:<\/p> <p>## Using R to help plan the future of transport<\/p> <p>The primary motivation for developing these packages has been their use in Active Transport Futures - a group of researchers and coders striving to aid cities to better plan for futures in which active travel, particularly walking and cycling, plays an increasingly prominent role (lots of open source code at github.com/ATFutures). We will take a close look at the packages \"osmdata\" and \"dodgr\", the first of which imports Open Street Map (OSM) data directly into R, while the second is a very powerful, large-scale routing engine. These two packages enable accurate estimates of densities of different kinds of transport along all individual street segments of a city. The development of these packages has been partly motivated by their use in the Urban Health Agenda of the World Health Organization. I will also demonstrate a few other tools currently being developed for this work, including a brand new package to very easily set up a web server for large amounts of spatial data, and finally one of our main current projects, moveability.city.<\/p> <p>About the speaker: Mark has programmed in C++ for many years, and started using R as a way to get his code noticed by people, which seems to have worked. Along with several others, he is in the process of establishing moveability.city to provide a global-scale, open source platform to help cities transition towards environmentally and socially sustainable transport, and more equitable - and active - use of public space. He will be discussing:<\/p> <p>Our second speaker will be Dr. Daniel Lüdecke. He will be discussing his new project of developing a suite of packages for statistics:<\/p> <p>## easystats: Make R stats easy!<\/p> <p>The aim of the project \"easystats\" is to provide a unifying and consistent<br/>framework to tame, discipline and harness the scary R statistics and their<br/>pesky models.<\/p> <p>About the speaker: Daniel is a researcher at the \"Institut für Medizinische Soziologie\" at the UKE. Additionally he is a the author of several R packages including the sj familiy of packages.<\/p> ","visibility":"public","duration":7200000,"rsvp_limit":55}]
